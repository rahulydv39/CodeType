## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(220, 70%, 50%) - A moderate blue, rendered in hex as #3D84A8, to evoke a sense of focus and clarity.
- Background color: HSL(220, 20%, 20%) - A dark, desaturated blue-gray, rendered in hex as #333F48, provides a comfortable, distraction-free background.
- Accent color: HSL(190, 70%, 50%) - A teal color, rendered in hex as #3DAB8F, used for highlighting interactive elements and important information.
- Font Pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use minimalist, monochrome icons for language selection and chapter navigation.
- Implement an open/close sidebar for language and chapter selection, with a clear separation between the code snippet and typing area.
- Subtle transitions when loading code snippets and displaying typing statistics.
